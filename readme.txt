This plugin's added email recipients feature supersedes the limitation of WooCommerce's single email and address entered in the store setup. This function is desirable for WooCommerce installations that need to submit new orders directly to different sponsors, manufacturers, dropship affiliates, warehouse contacts, and an endless number of other endpoints, with the option to include the address for shipping accuracy.

== Description ==

<strong>Multi-Emails for WooCommerce</strong> provides unique control over the "ship from" email and address assigned to a category of products or a single product or combination thereof added to WooCommerce. Instead of being limited to one email and address assigned within the Woocommerce store setup, now you can apply any number of emails along with the option of a unique "ship from" point of origin. This allows orders to be submitted to assigned emails apart from the WooCommerce default email and calculates shipping based on the point of origin address entered.

<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> The logic of this plugin dictates that the buyer cannot combine products (WordPress default email address and assigned shipping address) in the same order. If an item is placed in the cart that is selected by the plugin to be shipped from a plugin-defined address, a cart message alerts the buyer that only the items listed in the "X" category(s) can be purchased at the same time, not in combination with other items not related to that unique shipping point. Otherwise, the calculated shipping results will not be accurate. The admin can customize the message for the cart notice in settings.

This order multi-email plugin can be combined with digital asset purchases and non-deliverable items, but these items must be assigned a unique category unrelated to physical products to avoid conflicts.

As a bonus, this plugin also allows an administrator to optionally choose to modify the registered user's contact profile by entering multiple email fields under their user profile and making them accessible from the shopping cart. This way a customer may choose to be contacted about an order from different entered emails for their convenience. The admin must create labels for each email field with titles like "Email Two" and "Email Three" as examples for adding two additional email fields.

The plugin's language support includes English, Spanish, French, and Russian.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name' directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Enter the required content from the settings screen link found in the WooCommerce menu.

== Using in Multisite Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file contents in the wp-content/mu-plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation. (This is not created by default. You must create it in the wp-content folder.) The 'mu' does not stand for multi-user like it did for WPMU, it stands for 'must-use' as any code placed in that folder will run without needing to be activated.
2. Access the Plugins settings panel named 'Multi-Emails for WooCommerce' under options.
3. Enter the required content from the settings screen link found in the WooCommerce menu.
